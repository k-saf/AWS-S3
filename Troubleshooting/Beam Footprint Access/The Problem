# 🌐 S3 Public Access Troubleshooting – Orbit3 Coverage Maps

Welcome to another AWS troubleshooting scenario!  
This time, our fictional satellite startup, Orbit3 is trying to share coverage maps and beam footprints for their **Ku- and Ka-band satellites** using **Amazon S3**.

---------------

## 📖 Scenario

The Orbit3 cloud engineering team have so far: 
- Uploaded the beam coverage map to a general-purpose **S3 bucket**, 
- **Disabled Block Public Access (BPA)** on the bucket
- Attached a **bucket policy** to allow public access

They expected users outside AWS to be able to view the file through a public URL, but that’s not happening.

You can find the actual bucket policy they used in this folder.  
Can you spot what they missed?

## 🚀 Why This Matters

This is a common real-world pitfall in cloud environments:  
**Assuming one layer of access control is enough**, when multiple layers must be aligned.


Happy debugging! 🧠⚡
